## Code Contributions

When contributing to this repository, it is generally a good idea to discuss the change with the owners before investing
a lot of time coding. The process could be:

1. Open an issue explaining the improvement or fix you want to add
2. [Fork the project](https://github.com/starvn/xstava/fork_select)
3. Code it in your fork
4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) referencing the issue

Your work will then be reviewed as soon as possible (suggestions about some changes, improvements or alternatives may be
given).

**Don't forget to add tests**, make sure that they all pass!

# Help with Git

Once the repository is forked, you should track the upstream (original) one using the following command:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/starvn/xstava.git

Then you should create your own branch:

    git checkout -b <prefix>/<micro-title>-<issue-number>

Once your changes are done (`git commit -am '<descriptive-message>'`), get the upstream changes:

    git checkout master
    git pull --rebase origin master
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git checkout <your-branch>
    git rebase master

Finally, publish your changes:

    git push -f origin <your-branch>

You should be now ready to make a pull request.
